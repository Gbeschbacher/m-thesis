\section{Methods}
The first part of this chapter provides an overview of the related work in the field of
thematic cartography. This topic is going to be combined with basic principles of visualizations and visual design principles. Afterwards, \ac{GeoVis} is explained from a practical point of view and the connections to close related fields are made. This rather high level discussion is followed by a more specialized view on four different map-based visualizations. The combination of thematic cartography and interaction leads to the next sections, where different interaction approaches are explained in detail. Finally the current state in the domain of map-based visualization tools is analysed, summarized and potential improvements are identified.
