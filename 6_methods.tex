\section{Methods}
\label{s:methods}
The first part of this Chapter provides an overview of geo-spatial visualisation and its related field of thematic cartography with a particular focus on univariate thematic map types. In addition, basic principles of map design and methods are shown and the connection to the basic principles of visualisations is made.
% This is followed by a practical explanation of \ac{GeoVis}.
The combination of thematic cartography and interaction leads to the next Section, where different interaction approaches are explained in detail. Finally, the current state in the domain of map-based visualisation tools is analysed, summarised, and potential improvements are identified.
