\section{Methods}
\label{s:methods}
The first part of this chapter provides an overview of geo-spatial visualisation and its related field of thematic cartography with a particular focus on univariate thematic map types. In addition, basic principles of map design and methods are shown and the connection to the basic principles of visualisations is made. The combination of thematic cartography and interaction leads to the next section, where different interaction approaches are explained in detail. Finally, the current state in the domain of map-based visualisation tools is analysed, summarised, and potential improvements are identified.
