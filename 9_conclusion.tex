\section{Outlook}\label{s:outlook}
Future work includes creating the actual evaluation framework introduced in section \ref{s:requirements}. Therefore the \ac{gvgai} framework has to be analysed and adapted. There are several changes necessary to meet the requirements specified. These have to be laid out.
For the evaluation of the framework concrete algorithms have to be found capable of solving \ac{dda} and \ac{mal} need to be explained and adapted and used in the respective controller. The different controllers need then be tested with the evaluation framework.
The results then are used to evaluate the framework. Afterwards there should be a framework which can be used as standard for evaluating algorithms targeting to solve \ac{dda} for single-cooperative agents.
