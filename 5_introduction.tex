\ac{ai} is defined as the ability of machines to act and think similar to humans \iacite[29]{millington.2009}. Usually the behaviour of an \ac{ai} is abstracted by the game designer and then implemented. This way they are solving the specific problem in the intended way. Most often those \acp{ai} are inflexible and tend to fail to perform in different domains.
