\section*{Abstract}

There has never been such a large amount of data available in history and the global amount of information has never grown so fast and continuous. Processing and analysis of data garners increased economic and scientific interest. Finding useful and usable information in a multitude of data is a tedious and time consuming task. Visualisations are a handy tool to explore unknown data. However, there are many different types of visualisations possible to achieve one objective. Choosing the best visual representation is often based on the domain knowledge of the creator. They are often unaware of the strengths and weaknesses of each type of visualisation and therefore also its use cases. Thus, this thesis presents a way of using animated transitions between different visual representations to help pointing out their advantages and disadvantages. The implemented application trying to achieve this is publicly available and its usefulness is tested with a user study.
