This chapter discusses the implementation of the concepts and visualisation techniques. At this point, the findings of this thesis will be presented. The discussion is split into two parts: the first part analyses different aspects of the practical implementation related to the research question of how an animated aggregation can be realised. The second part presents and discusses the findings of the performed user study and therefore provides answers of the derived research question.
