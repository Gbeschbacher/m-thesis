\section{Visualization}
Visualization is not a new phenomenon. It has been used in maps, scientific drawings and data plots for over a thousand years. Examples of this are the map of China and the famous map of Napoleon's invasion of Russia which are explained later in detail. Most of the concepts learned in devising these images carry over in a straight forward manner to computer visualization \iacite{Tufte:1990}.

The first part of this chapter provides an overview of important milestones in the history of visualization. The history is followed by a definition of visualization in literature and a varieties of visualization for this thesis. This yields to the basis to be able to define different types of visualizations like \ac{InfoVis}, \ac{SciVis} and \ac{GeoVis} (which are all explained in detail in chapter \ref{s:definitions-types} on page \pageref{s:definitions-types}). The definitions are followed by an essential discussion about the basic principles of data visualizations and differnet types of visualizations.

The second part of this chapter uses the knowledge of the first part to describe exploratory data analysis in conjunction with visualizations. This is also done with some pratical applications and examples which are also used to segue into the next chapter which deals with \ac{GeoVis}. It is used to show different types and use cases of \ac{GeoVis}. Therefore some related works and their problems are mentioned.

\subsection{Geovisualization}
% In modern geovisualization software, such data are represented using both traditional cartographic techniques based on the use of colours, textures, symbols, and diagrams; and using computer-enabled techniques such as map animation and interactive 3D views. Moreover, maps are used in combination with nongeographic visualization techniques such as scatterplots or parallel coordinates. The use of multiple interactively linked views providing different perspectives into the data has become a kind of standard in geovisualization. However, a number of problems have yet to be solved, such as the scalability of geovisualization tools and their usability.
