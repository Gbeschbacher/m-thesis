Visualisation is not a new phenomenon. It has been used in maps, scientific drawings, and data plots for over a thousand years \iacite{Friendly.2001}. Examples of this are the map of China and the famous map of Napoleon's invasion of Russia which are explained later in detail. Most of the concepts learned in devising these images carry over in a straightforward manner to computer visualisation \iacite{Tufte:1990}.

The first part of this Section provides an overview of significant milestones in the history of visualisation. It is followed by a definition of visualisation in literature and basic principles of why, when and how to visualise.

\cbstart
The second part of this Section uses the knowledge of the first part, especially the ones of the essential discussion of why, when and how to visualise which yield the distinction between visualisations for presentation and exploration. With these basic principles in mind, it is possible to define an alphabet for visualisations. The Chapter is completed with a Section about the former subfields of visualisations and their blurring borders. It also includes a definition for \acl{GeoVis}, which is used to segue into the next Chapter.
