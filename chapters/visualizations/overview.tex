Visualisation is not a new phenomenon. It has been used in maps, scientific drawings, and data plots for over a thousand years \iacite{Friendly.2001}. Examples of this are the map of China and the famous map of Napoleon's invasion of Russia which are explained later in detail. Most of the concepts learned in devising these images carry over in a straightforward manner to computer visualisation \iacite{Tufte:1990}.

The first part of this Section provides an overview of significant milestones in the history of visualisation. It is followed by a definition of visualisation in literature and a varieties of visualisation for this thesis, yielding to the basis to be able to define different types of visualisation like \ac{InfoVis}, \ac{SciVis} and \ac{GeoVis} (which are all explained in detail in Section \ref{s:definitions-types} on page \pageref{s:definitions-types}). The definitions are followed by an essential discussion about the basic principles of data visualisations and differnet types of visualisations.

The second part of this Section uses the knowledge of the first part to describe exploratory data analysis in conjunction with visualisations. This is also done with some practical applications and examples which are also used to segue into the next Chapter which deals with \ac{GeoVis}. It is used to show different types and use cases of \ac{GeoVis}.
