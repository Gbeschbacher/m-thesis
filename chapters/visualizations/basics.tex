\citeauthor{Munzner2014} answers a lot of questions concerning the usage of visualizations in her book called "Visualization Analysis and Design". This chapter will discuss the most important answers because they are a necessity in understanding questions like when, why and how to visualize. Furthermore it introduces an analysis framework for visualization tools in order to compare different tools with the same base.

From today's perspective with the ability to use artificial intelligence and machine learning, the question if we still need a human in order to create visualizations is very valid. This questions as a very simple answer: if well-defined questions to ask about data exist in advance, it is possible to answer these purely with computational techniques from fields such as statistics and machine learning. If a solution to a problem has been fully automatized and has been deemed to be acceptable, there is no need for human judgement anymore and thus no need to design a visualization tool. An example for a practical application would be the domain of stock market trading. A tool in that field can be fully automatized currently there are many deployed systems for high-frequency trading. Those systems make decisions about buying and selling stocks when certain market conditions hold \iacite{Munzner2014}. Some other reasons where computers beat humans are mentioned below:
\begin{itemize}
\item Scale: Drawing a dataset of hundreds of thousands of items by hand is infeasible and would take a lot of time.
\item Efficiency: Once a problem has been solved with a computer it can be reused  indefinitely for different datasets and scenarios.
\item Quality: Precise data-driven rendering.
\end{itemize}
However many analysis problems are very poorly specified. Either the approach to the problem is unknown, or it is not obvious which questions the data could or should answer. In such a case, \citeauthor{Munzner2014} says, that the best path forward is an analysis process with a human in the loop. Even though there are a lot of use cases for a human in the loop, this paper only discusses one which deals with \ac{EDA} (see chapter \ref{s:eda} on page \pageref{s:eda} for more information.), which is essential for this thesis. Exploratory analysis in scientific discovery is a common case of the need of a human. A long-term visualization tool which could be developed is a tool with the goal of speeding up and improving user's ability to generate and check hypothesis \iacite{Munzner2014}.

Another important question answered by \citeauthor{Munzner2014} is: why depend on vision? As chapter \ref{s:definition} on page \pageref{s:definition} already mentions, a part of visualization is based on exploiting the human visual system as a means of communication. A significant amount of visual information processing occurs in parallel through high-bandwidth channels to our brain. One example \citeauthor{Munzner2014} mentions is visual popout: one red item in a sea of gray ones is immediately noticed.

Furthermore a single static view can show only one aspect of a dataset. This fact is already part of the answer of the next question: why use interactivity? Even though there are combinations of simple datasets and tasks where only a single visual encoding and therefore a single static view is needed, it does not apply for large complex datasets where interactivity allows to change displays and supports many possible queries. Interactivity could be used to investigate multiple levels of detail at once, ranging from a very specific detailed view of a small part to a very high-level summarization \iacite{Munzner2014}.

The main goal of a design of a visualization is to satisfy rather than optimize. One of the many possible good solutions to a problem is much harder to find than one of the even larger number of bad ones. Yet the validation of satisfaction is very difficult because there are so many questions considering wheter a visualization tool has met the design goals \iacite{Munzner2014}.

Furthermore it is needed to keep at least three different kinds of limitations in mind when designing or analyzing visualizatoins:
\begin{enumerate}
\item computational capacity,
\item human perceptual and cognitive capacity and
\item display capacity.
\end{enumerate}

All three limitations can be subsumized with the term scalability.

One of the most important questions \citeauthor{Munzner2014} answers is called: why analyze? In order to answer the question they feature an analysis framework that helps to think about design choices for visualizations systematically. Figure \ref{fig:an-framework} on page \pageref{fig:an-framework} shows the high-level framework they provide for analyzing a visualization's use according to three questions: what data does a user see, why does the user intend to use a visualization tool and how are the visual encoding and interaction idioms constructed in terms of design choices \iacite{Munzner2014}.

\label{fig:an-framework}
\end{figure}

At this time, two out of three main questions for this chapter have been solved. A visualization should be made if there are no questions according to given data knwon in advance. If a visualization is combined with \ac{EDA}, it emphasizes knowledge construction over knowledge storage or information transmission, therefore answering the question why to visualize.

In order to answer the last main question of this chapter, \citeauthor{Munzner2014} features figure \ref{fig:how} on page \pageref{fig:how} which provides a preview of a set of design choices, with a high-level breakdown into four major classes:

\begin{enumerate}

\ditem{Encode} \hfill \\
This first part of the figure deals with the encoding of how to arrange data spatially and shows five different choices:
    \begin{enumerate*}
    \item express values,
    \item seperate,
    \item order and
    \item align regions
    \item and use given spatial data directly.
    \end{enumerate*}
Another important aspect this part features is the usage of nonspatial visual channels including color, size, angle, shape and so forth according to the type of attribute. These channels are explained in detail later in this chapter.

\ditem{Manipulate} \hfill \\
The second part handles different approaches manipulating different aspects of the visualization like changing any aspect of the view, selecting elements from within the view and navigating to change the viewpoint within the view.

\ditem{Facet} \hfill \\
The third part shows three different choices of how to facet data between views.

\ditem{Reduce} \hfill \\
The fourth part again mentions three different options for how to reduce the data shown.

\end{enumerate}

\label{fig:how}
\end{figure}

Even though the main questions of this chapter are solved, one more question appeared in combination with the analysis framework: what? To summarize the usage of this framework, two more figures are introduced: figure \ref{fig:what} and \ref{fig:why} on page \pageref{fig:what} and \pageref{fig:why}.

Figure \ref{fig:what} starts with differentiating five different types of data (items, attributes, links, positions and grids) which is followed by dataset types consisting out of different combinations of these data types. Furthermore the availability of these datasets can be either immediately in the form of a static file, or in the form of a data stream.

]{What can be visualized: data, datasets, and attributes.}
\label{fig:what}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:why} is shown for the sake of completeness in combination with the analysis framework. It features two main parts: the reasons why a visualization tol is being used (actions and targets). The highest-level actions to use visualizations are either to consume or produce information. The second-level action can be summarized as a search. From an abstract point of view there is no difference in knowing the target or location one is looking for or not. It ends up with either looking up that specific target or browsing and exploring the given visualization in order to find it. At the low level, queries can be divided into three parts: identification of a specific target, comparison of multiple targets and the summarization of all targets.
The targets for all kinds of data are finding trends and outliers. This can be divided into two parts:
\begin{enumerate*}
\item finding one value, the extreme values or the distribution of all values for exactly one attribute, or
\item finding dependencies, correlations or similarities between multiple attributes.
\end{enumerate*}

The discussed framework will be used as a basis to analyse the related work mentioned in this thesis.
