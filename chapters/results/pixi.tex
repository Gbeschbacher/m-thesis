\ac{Pixi} is a fast and lightweight 2D library\footnote{See \href{http://www.pixijs.com/}{http://www.pixijs.com/} for more information.} built upon Canvas technology. Its renderer allows to enjoy e.g. hardware acceleration without the prior knowledge of \ac{WebGL}. Thus, \ac{Pixi} simplifies the creation of rich, interactive, cross platform applications without the need of knowledge of browser and device compatibility. Another characteristic of \ac{Pixi} is the seamless fallback of HTML5's canvas in case the browser is not supporting \ac{WebGL}.
\ac{Pixi} can therefore be used to draw a lot of items with the power of hardware acceleration, making it a good choice to draw a dot map with a lot of data items.
