The pracitcal application needs to meet some basic conditions, which are described below:

\begin{description}
\item[Scaling:] unit-based visualizations allow for showing a lot of items simultaneously and combined with animation, some patterns in data can be revealed. However, using a low amount of units will not result in showing patterns animations. Therefore, usig a mid-sized dataset is a key part of the practical implementation. Defining a mid-sized dataset is nebulous and for this thesis, it is defined as a dataset consisting of 5000 to 15000 rows. This amount should be enough for an experiment to investigate the question of how an aggregation can be realized.

\item[Modularity:] the practical implementation should have a modular structure in order to keep it extendable. It should be possible to add further visualizations and transitions for more investigation later on.

\item[Client-side application:] in order to save costs and abstractions, a client-side approach is required. This allows to put the focus on the implementation of different thematic maps and an animated transition between them without worrying about latency of server response.
