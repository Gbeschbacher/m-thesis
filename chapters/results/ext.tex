As already mentioned, the web-application uses the JavaScript version ECMAScript6. However, to use this version, a transpiler is needed. Babel\footnote{See \href{https://babeljs.io/}{https://babeljs.io/} for more information.} was chosen to fulfill this role because of its popularity. Furthermore, browserify\footnote{See \href{http://browserify.org/}{http://browserify.org/} for more information.} was used to maintain a component-based architecture and allowing to follow the concept of seperating concerns in files.
In order to keep an eye on performance, Stat.js\footnote{See \href{https://github.com/mrdoob/stats.js/}{https://github.com/mrdoob/stats.js/} for more information.} was used to display the current frames per second. It also allows to keep track of the milliseconds needed to render a frame and the \ac{Mb} of allocated memory. DatGui\footnote{See \href{https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui}{https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui} for more information.} simplifies the process of allowing the user to change configuration variables and therefore interacting with the visualisation.
