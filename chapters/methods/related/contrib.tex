Based on the discussion of the related work and novel visualisation approaches, one can see that there is no such tool combining geo-spatial visualisations with animations when changing the type of the visualisation. The advantages and disadvantages of all aspects have been broached and discussed. This thesis discusses and shows a novel approach based on the concept of unit visualisations combined with classical thematic maps and animations when changing visual appearance. However, there are multiple possible solutions. This chapter discusses some solutions with the requirement of building an interactive web application. The solutions should yield answers to the questions of which technologies are used and how an animated transition can be realised. In order to realise a practical solution for the given question, it is assumed that a dataset including heterogeneous data and some kind of geo-spatial data is given.

According to the mantra of \citeauthor{Shneiderman1996}, the application should start by giving an overview of the dataset \iacite{Shneiderman1996}. With the main concept in mind, there are three possible solutions:
\begin{enumerate}

\ditem{Unit-based grid} \hfill \\
SandDance features an approach of showing a grid as visualisation, where all data items are represented as some kind of shape. Figure \ref{fig:sanddance-grid} on page \pageref{fig:sanddance-grid} shows the implementation of a unit-based grid.

\ditem{Dot map} \hfill \\
Chapter \ref{s:dot} on page \pageref{s:dot} discusses the concept of dot maps in detail. This kind of thematic map can be used in combination with a one-to-one relationship and show every item in the dataset as a single dot on the map giving an overview of the whole dataset including its geographical distribution.

\ditem{Particle attractor} \hfill \\
Figure \ref{fig:particle-attractor} on page \pageref{fig:particle-attractor} sketches the concept of showing all data items around a particle attractor as an overview.

\begin{figure}[!htb]

\end{figure}

\end{enumerate}

The next step after having an overview is to decide which tasks to try out in order to test particle aggregation. One big part of this thesis already discussed in detail is thematic cartography. Thus, the decision of using different types of thematic maps, which are all based on some kind of aggregation, is reasonable. Therefore, trying animated particle aggregation in combination with proportional symbol maps, choropleth maps and cartograms is the main part of the practical approach. However, there are multiple ways in changing visual appearance from an overview of the data to some kind of thematic map. The following sections describe the basic transition types available when changing the visual appearance and specific transition concepts in geo-spatial visualisations. The chapter is concluded with technological considerations.
