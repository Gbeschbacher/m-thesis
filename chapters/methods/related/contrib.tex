Based on the discussion of the related work and novel visualisation approaches, one can see that there is no such tool combining geo-spatial visualisations with animations when changing the type of the visualisation. The advantages and disadvantages of all aspects have been broached and discussed. This thesis discusses and shows a novel approach based on the concept of unit visualisations combined with classical thematic maps and animations when changing visual appearance. However, there are multiple possible solutions. This chapter discusses some solutions with the requirement of building an interactive web application. The solutions should yield answers to the questions of which technologies are used and how an animated transition can be realised. In order to realise a practical solution for the given question, it is assumed that a dataset including heterogeneous data and some kind of geo-spatial data is given.

According to the mantra of \citeauthor{Shneiderman1996}, the application should start by giving an overview of the dataset \iacite{Shneiderman1996}. With the main concept in mind, there are three possible solutions:
\begin{enumerate}

\ditem{Unit-based grid} \hfill \\
SandDance features an approach of showing a grid as visualisation, where all data items are represented as some kind of shape. Figure \ref{fig:sanddance-grid} on page \pageref{fig:sanddance-grid} shows the implementation of a unit-based grid.

\ditem{Dot map} \hfill \\
Chapter \ref{s:dot} on page \pageref{s:dot} discusses the concept of dot maps in detail. This kind of thematic map can be used in combination with a one-to-one relationship and show every item in the dataset as a single dot on the map giving an overview of the whole dataset including its geographical distribution.

\ditem{Particle attractor} \hfill \\
Figure \ref{fig:particle-attractor} on page \pageref{fig:particle-attractor} sketches the concept of showing all data items around a particle attractor as an overview.

\begin{figure}[!htb]

\end{figure}

\end{enumerate}

The next step after having an overview is to decide which tasks to try out in order to test particle aggregation. One big part of this thesis already discussed in detail is thematic cartography. Thus, the decision of using different types of thematic maps, which are all based on some kind of aggregation, is reasonable. Therefore, trying animated particle aggregation in combination with proportional symbol maps, choropleth maps and cartograms is the main part of the practical approach. However, there are multiple ways in changing visual appearance from an overview of the data to some kind of thematic map. The following sections describe the basic transition types available when changing the visual appearance and specific transition concepts in geo-spatial visualisations. The chapter is concluded with technological considerations.

% At the beginning of this section, it is mentioned that the requirement of an interactive web application is given. However, this requirement needs to distinguish two different concepts of web applications:

% \begin{enumerate}

% \ditem{Pure client-side web application} \hfill \\
% A client typically is a computer application, that runs on a user's local computer. With the context of a web application, a client is basically a web browser. In order to reach a web application, a client needs to connect to a server. With a pure client-side concept, the server returns static files only, thus leaving all further operations and calculations with the application on the client. The main advantage of such a concept is, that server costs can be significantly decreased and latency is basically not given when the first connection has been established. However, using the client for all further operations can be either an advantage or disadvantage, depending on the client's performance. If the client's hardware can handle a lot of operations, the web application will be extremely fast. However, if this is not the case and calculations, animations, etc. will take some time to be done, it will feel unnatural and unrewarding.

% \ditem{Client-side web application combined with a server} \hfill \\
% SandDance uses such a concept for its unit-based visualisation tool. The main difference to pure client-side web applications is, that operations and calculations are done on the server and the results are forwarded to the client. The client is only used to display information with animations and other concepts. This concept of a web-application needs a more abstract structure because client-server communication is obligatory. The information exchange will not affect a client in any way if the latency between a client and a server can be kept really low and the server has enough resources to perform fast.
% \end{enumerate}

% The technology used heavily depends on the decision of the type of web application. For the sake of convenience and no costs, the practical approach is implemented as a pure client-side application. Thus, the technological possibilities are restricted to \ac{SVG}, Canvas\footnote{See \href{https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTML/Canvas}{https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTML/Canvas} for more information.} and WebGL\footnote{See \href{https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API}{https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/API/WebGL\_API} for more information.}. The JavaScript library D3.js\footnote{See \href{https://d3js.org/}{https://d3js.org/} for more information.} makes it easy to create a \ac{SVG} in the browser. The creation can furthermore be extended with interactions. Canvas features a lot of 2D functionalities to create graphics and bitmap pictures. WebGL extends functionalities of canvas in 3D.
