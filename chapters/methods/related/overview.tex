Even though a lot of visualisation tools for different use cases emerged, there is only a small amount of tools trying to animate the transition between two visualisations. This chapter provides three types of exemplarily selected tools:

\begin{enumerate}
\item tools that use some kind of animation to create the visualisation,
\item tools that also allow creating maps and
\item tools that try to animate the transition when changing the visual appearance.
\end{enumerate}

In order to evaluate all presented works with the same base, the analysis framework mentioned in Chapter \ref{s:basics} on page \pageref{s:basics} is used.
