The two major categories of cartography are general cartography and thematic cartography, which are introduced in chapter \ref{s:cartography} on page \pageref{s:cartography}. This categorization can be directly mapped from cartography to maps. The main objective of this chapter is to give an overview of different thematic maps and their usage. These maps can be subdivided into univariate and multivariate maps.

\subsubsubsection{Univariate Thematic Map Types}
Univariate maps are only dependent on one variable, except for the map variables like latitude and longitude and suchlike.
