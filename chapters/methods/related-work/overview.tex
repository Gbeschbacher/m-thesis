Even though a lot of visualization tools for different use cases emerged, there is only a small amount of tools trying to animate the transition between two visulizations. This chapter provides three types of exemplarily selected tools:

\begin{enumerate*}
\item tools that use some kind of animation to create the visualization,
\item tools that also allow to create maps and
\item tools that try to animate the transition when chaning the visual appearance.
\end{enumerate*}

In order to evaluate all applications with the same base, the analysis framework mentioned in chapter \ref{s:basics} on page \pageref{s:basics} is used.
