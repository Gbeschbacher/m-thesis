Showing detailed information upon interaction on a dot map based on a dataset with 10000 data items describes the concept of showing details on demand. It would be infeasible to show details on all entries, as the screen-space is limited. Even with unlimited screen-space it would drastically worsen the readability of the map. \citeauthor{Ahlberg:1996} explains one possible way of implementing this concept. His approach is to only show objects that match certain criteria and are therefore likely of interest to the user. However, the user needs to start this task first with some kind of interaction, e.g. clicking on a visual object of a specific kind. The additional information is then shown in a pop-up window \iacite{Ahlberg:1996}.
