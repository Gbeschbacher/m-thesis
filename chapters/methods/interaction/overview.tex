When designing maps, there is one important distinction: designing maps for print versus a digital environment. For the first case, the design is for map readers, whereas for the latter case, it is for map users. The difference between readers and users lies in the interaction. This chapter focuses on a map designed for a digital , e.g. for viewing on a display and therefore allowing a lot more interaction. Users do not only interact but also manipulate maps. Interaction for print maps would be moving a paper map closer or further away to one's eyes, or trim specific parts with scissors and so forth. The weakness of this kind of interaction is that the data on the map stays the same. However, zooming, selecting and moving a digital map actually allows for adapting the data shown \iacite{Muehlenhaus2014}.

\citeauthor{Shneiderman1996} published an often cited mantra to create good visualisations \iacite{Shneiderman1996}:

``Overview first, zoom and filter, then details on demand.''

The first part of this chapter introduces some basic interaction methods and concepts. The second part builds upon the knowledge of the first part and maps the basic concepts to today's implementations with the focus on interaction with thematic maps.
